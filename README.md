Becoming familiar with GitHub

I come from a background in mathematics, but I hope to transition into industry where I might better build a comfortable and successful future. The impetus for this change was provided by the passing of my father, Paul, whose name I have adopted in my username. The inspiration was provided by Jeff Schwab, who convinced me that I might find my fortune here.
